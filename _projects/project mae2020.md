Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (of my choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (use max force values only), I needed to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height, assuming all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

My design included actuator IMA 22, and the maximum weight that could be lifted that I calculated was 1.25 N, according to the dimensions in the online catalog, as displayed in the image.

Given: 
Peak thrust = 1.45 kN
lenght of actuator = 12.86 cm
stroke length = 30.48 cm
W=?

Solution:
Taking moment about A:
W(150) = 1.45(130.02)
W = 1.26 kN is the maximum weight that could be lifted
