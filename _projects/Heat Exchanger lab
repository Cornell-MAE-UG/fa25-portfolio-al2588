Purpose and real-world relevance

In this lab we analyzed a real water-to-water heat exchanger and compared its performance in parallel-flow and counterflow configurations. Our goals were to (1) describe how the exchanger works physically, (2) apply mass, energy, and entropy balances to a real system, and (3) determine how changing an operating/design condition changes performance. Heat exchangers like this are central to many engineering systems, including car radiators, HVAC units, power-plant condensers and feedwater heaters, chemical reactors with cooling jackets, and refrigeration systems. Therefore, this lab provided us with a realistic thermodynamics outcome to share with employers.

Device description (qualitative)

A heat exchanger is a device that transfers heat from a hot fluid to a cold fluid without allowing the two fluids to mix. The fluids flow through separate channels, and heat moves through the wall from the hotter side to the colder side. As the hot fluid releases heat and cools down, the cold fluid absorbs that heat and warms up.

Heat exchangers can be arranged in:
- Parallel flow: both fluids move in the same direction. The temperature difference is largest at the inlet and quickly decreases along the exchanger, which generally reduces heat transfer.
- Counterflow: fluids move in opposite directions. This maintains a larger temperature difference over more of the exchanger length, which generally increases heat transfer and enables higher cold-side outlet temperatures.

Starting the hot fluid at a higher temperature increases the temperature difference, allowing more heat to transfer in both arrangements, with counterflow typically benefiting the most.

We tested two configurations:
- Parallel flow: hot and cold streams flow in the same direction. The temperature difference is largest at the inlet and decreases quickly along the exchanger length.
- Counterflow: hot and cold streams flow in opposite directions. This maintains a larger temperature difference over a greater portion of the exchanger, allowing counterflow to transfer more heat for the same inlet conditions.

Table 2. Heat transfer results (as reported)
| Run | (Tc) (K) | (Qc) (kW) | (Th) (K) | (Qh) (kW) |
|-----|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1   | 9.1      | 8.40      | 15.4     | 14.21     |
| 2   | 12.4     | 11.44     | 11.3     | 10.43     |
| 3   | 12.9     | 11.91     | 17.0     | 15.69     |
| 4   | 13.9     | 12.83     | 20.4     | 18.83     |

Observation: Based on the cold-side measurements, the exchanger transferred roughly 8–13 kW across our runs.

We expect some mismatch between Qc and Qh because of real-system effects, including heat loss from tubing/exchanger to the room, unequal pump flow rates, imperfect reservoir mixing, and thermometer lag/placement. This is typical outside ideal textbook conditions.

Table 3. Effectiveness (ε)
| Run | Configuration              |    ε |
| --: | -------------------------- | ---: |
|   1 | Parallel                   | 0.27 |
|   2 | Parallel                   | 0.47 |
|   3 | Counterflow                | 0.50 |
|   4 | Counterflow (hotter start) | 0.46 |

For the most fair comparison between flow arrangements, we compared Run 2 (parallel flow) and Run 3 (counterflow) because they began with nearly the same hot-side inlet temperature (~35 °C) and very similar cold-side inlet temperatures. Under these matched conditions, the counterflow setup performed slightly better: it achieved a higher effectiveness and transferred heat to the cold stream at a slightly greater rate than the parallel-flow setup.

Conclusions

From this lab we demonstrated real thermodynamic analysis of a working heat exchanger:
- We measured cold-side heat transfer rates of roughly 8–13 kW.
- Under similar inlet conditions, counterflow produced higher effectiveness (0.50) than parallel flow (0.47).
- Increasing hot-reservoir inlet temperature in counterflow increased heat transfer by about 8%.
- Energy-rate mismatches between sides were expected due to real losses and uneven flow.

Overall, this experiment gave us a concrete example of applying mass, energy, and entropy balances to a real device, and it showed how both a design change (flow arrangement) and an operating change (hot inlet temperature) directly affect heat-exchanger performance.
