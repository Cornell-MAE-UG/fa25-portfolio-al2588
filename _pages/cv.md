#### Projects
- **[Safety System for Aircraft Water Landing in Emergency Situations]**:  
  *[A safety system for aircraft landing on water in emergencies, which is based on the principle of automobile airbags made of the Nylon-Graphene composite.]*  

- **[Determining the relationship between the temperature and the coagulation efficiency of the Moringa Oleifera seeds (using spectrophotometry)]**:  
  *[This research project examined how varying temperatures (20°C to 60°C) influence the coagulation efficiency of Moringa Oleifera seed extract in reducing water turbidity. Using a rigorously controlled experimental setup—including standardized soil suspensions, precise temperature regulation, and spectrophotometric measurements—the study demonstrated that higher temperatures significantly enhance the extract’s ability to coagulate contaminants. The findings support the potential application of natural coagulants as sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives in water treatment processes.]*
